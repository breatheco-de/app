# 4Geeks Developers Community

## Getting Started.

1. Install Bun:

```bash
# If bun has not been installed in your work environment (Gitpod, Codespaces, and more)
npm install -g bun 
```

2. Install packages:

```bash
bun install
```

3. Copy `.env.example` content to `.env.development` and `.env.production`

4. Then generate required files before start:

```bash
bun prepare-repo
# or
bun run prepare-repo
```

5. Then, run the development server:

```bash
bun run dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
